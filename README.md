# ASP.NET Core / React Example Project

This example project is a simplified flight management software for a BHS (baggage handling system). In a BHS, bags are introduced into the system at the ticket counters and a scanner before the sortation system will read the tag on the bag. Sortation will use the scanned tag to 
find a flight in the flight schedule to determine what sort destination the bag needs to be sent to. The sort destination is written to the lower level and the lower level will track/divert the bag to the sort destination.

On startup, the example project pregenerates a few airlines, gates and sort destinations and then, a flight schedule is pregenerated; a flight every 10 minutes between 4AM and 10PM. The example has two pages, airlines and flight schedule.

## Airline
The airlines page allows the user to add/edit/delete airlines.
